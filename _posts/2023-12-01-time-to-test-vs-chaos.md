While in their book they emphasise the value of test automation and deployment pipelines from the start of a project (and they're undoubtedly right in this regard), this principle of early feedback applies to other kinds of information relvant to quality, including exploratory testing, customer validation, security audits, and so on.

The fashionable term for this concept in software today is to "shift-left". Managers of Lean production systems might instead speak of single-piece flow and _[jidoka](https://mag.toyota.co.uk/jidoka-toyota-production-system/)_ to ensure fast feedback and continuous improvement. But the "time vs chaos" graph from the GOOS book is a particularly memorable image.
