The socialised preconceptions that we have of leadership and teamwork are dangerous verging on outright destructive (and thus senior management often lacks the understanding of what to promote for, and recently promoted managers make poor assumptions about how to start behaving).

Schein articulates this well:

> The U.S. culture is individualistic, competitive, optimistic and pragmatic. ... Most important of all, _we value task accomplishment over relationship building_ and either are not aware of this cultural bias or, worse, _don't care and don't want to be bothered with it_.

Deming speaks to the consequences on people:

> Our prevailing system of management has destroyed our people. People are born with intrinsic motivation, self-respect, dignity, curiosity to learn, joy in learning. The forces of destruction begin with toddlers–a prize for the best halloween costume, grades in school, gold stars–and on up through the university. On the job, people, teams, and divisions are ranked, rewarded for the top, punished for the bottom. Management by Objectives, quotas, incentive pay, business plans, put together separately, division by division, cause further loss, unknown and unknowable.

There's a feminist angle to this. Traditional leadership values are stereotypically masculine (authority, assertiveness, confidence, competitiveness). It happens to be that more stereotypically feminine traits (listening, helping, caring) are actually more important in management to create psychological safety - which seems to be the best known predictor of high performing teams. But our culture devalues femininity. Reclaiming it will benefit everyone in the workplace.
