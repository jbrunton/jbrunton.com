I often recommend to people who are moving into management or leadership positions that they take some time to learn about the discipline of systems thinking. Being an engineer, I'd like to reuse that answer, so here it is for reference.

# Some Definitions

In the context of systems thinking, **a system is a set of interconnected elements with a purpose** – from cells to organs to animals to organisations to societies to central heating and bathtubs. Systems thinking is simply the discipline of understanding systems and their behavior.

It generally comes in two flavours, though they share the same language: the theory of stocks and flows that allows us to model dynamic complexity, and the anthropological study of human systems. The former, more technical flavor can be used to model and simulate actual systems, including manufacturing plants and process queues. This is handy. But it’s the anthropological flavor where it gets really interesting: the language of systems thinking rejects the linear narratives we're conditioned to see (through language, culture and the limitations of human cognition), and instead reveals the systemic conditions that give rise to the patterns of behaviour we observe.

# Systems Thinking and Management

There's a wonderful thing that W. E. Deming once said, which I think should be studied by anyone who moves into management:

> If you have a stable system, there is no use to specify a goal. You will get whatever the system will deliver. A goal beyond the capability of the system will not be reached. If you have not a stable system, there is no point setting a goal. There is no way to know what the system will produce: it has no capability.

In these four succinct sentences, Deming spells out everything that is wrong with 'traditional' management methods. This conclusion may seem intuitive (systems thinking often is) – and perhaps what's most surprising is that such an obvious conclusion is so rarely reached in the organizations within which we work and live. Indeed, it is a modern day tragedy that organizations often go out of their way to avoid facing this truth.

The human element was extremely important to Deming, who wrote later in his life:

> Our prevailing system of management has destroyed our people. People are born with intrinsic motivation, self-respect, dignity, curiosity to learn, joy in learning. The forces of destruction begin with toddlers–a prize for the best halloween costume, grades in school, gold stars–and on up through the university. On the job, people, teams, and divisions are ranked, rewarded for the top, punished for the bottom. Management by Objectives, quotas, incentive pay, business plans, put together separately, division by division, cause further loss, unknown and unknowable.

In general, systems thinking rejects traditional management ideas: that if you get people to put more effort in you'll get more out; that if there is a failure then there must be a linear causal chain (i.e. someone or something to blame). Instead it encourages us to look for ways to transform the system in order to discover and realise possibilities that were unavailable to us before. Donella Meadows categorises twelve ways in which we can influence systems: those favored by traditional management styles (heroics; bonuses; overtime; etc.) are those which maintain the system and attempt to increase what it does. According to Meadows, this is the least effective type of intervention. There are eleven others to learn about (which include some of those common to Lean Thinking, especially stocks and delays).

# Systems Thinking for the Servant-Leader

Thus, systems thinking is an essential tool for the servant-leader. It offers ways to see opportunities that traditional hierarchies overlook. It also provides a justification for occasional top-down interventions: to make parts of the system itself visible, or to change it so that new options are made available to those within.

# Getting Started

The books that I always recommend as introduction to the field are:

1. *Systems Thinking: A Primer* by Donella Meadows, which is a great intro to the language of systems thinking.

2. *Seeing Systems* by Barry Oshry: an intriguing look at human systems from an anthropological perspective, presented in an eclectic (and powerful) mixture of prose, poetry and theatre.

3. *The Fifth Discipline* by Peter Senge. Better known, insightful in the connections it makes between systems thinking and the other disciplines which Senge argues are necessary for a learning organization to master, but not as elegant an introduction as the other two.
