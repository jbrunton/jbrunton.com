The term ‘accountability’ is frequently used in the context of teams and organizations, but it is often deployed in ways that are vague, contradictory or counterproductive.

In fact, we sometimes define the term simply through its absence: it’s not uncommon for teams or organisations to identify a ‘lack of accountability’ as a problem, without clearly articulating how this void should be filled. This article surveys some of the more productive notions of accountability from the literature, and the role of management in implementing them.

# Common interpretations

In different contexts, interpretations of ‘accountability’ may include the following.

1. **Formal performance management processes**, e.g. performance reviews and employee gradings/rankings. These are known to frequently be counterproductive due to delayed feedback, unfair review processes, and a focus on criticism [Carucci 2020]. While managers should facilitate useful, frequent feedback to support personal development, an annual performance review is no good as a mechanism for accountability.
2. Holding someone “accountable” is sometimes **a euphemism for finding someone to publicly blame**. It’s well known that such a punitive approach undermines psychological safety, engendering a culture in which problems are hidden rather than acknowledged and learned from [Edmondson 2018].
3. Sometimes the term is simply **conflated with “responsibility”**, or used as the term for the key decision-maker (e.g. in a RACI matrix). This may tell us who is accountable, but it doesn’t tell us what accountability should look like.
4. We also speak of accountability for **serious transgressions** (e.g. behaviours which contribute towards a toxic workplace culture, or which may even be illegal). These cases are important to deal with quickly [Felps 2006] but should be distinguished from accountability in a complex dynamic system, in which failures can occur despite the best efforts of all.
5. Tiresomely, the term has also become one of those words co-opted from therapists to gaslight an audience into thinking a mistake has been recognised. When a YouTuber promises to “take accountability” for their latest crypto scam, you know you’re witnessing a PR manoeuvre and that zero consequences will follow.

# A better approach

Sydney Dekker [2014] suggests we should interpret ‘accountability’ literally:

> ### You can hold people accountable by letting them tell their story, literally “giving their account.”

In other words, let people explain what happened, what should be done to fix things, and (ideally) how to improve in future. Accountability of this kind can be a great catalyst for learning.

This approach has other multiplicative benefits which are suppressed by punitive and bureaucratic interpretations:

1. As Dekker observes, “Storytelling is a powerful mechanism for others to learn vicariously from trouble.” Personal stories resonate with peers more strongly than any process change or training video ever could.
2. It engages frontline staff in identifying problems, from which it is a small step (with the right supporting structures) to have teams drive meaningful improvements to their own processes.
3. It contributes to a culture of psychological safety (more on which below), improving information flow, a prerequisite for a safety culture. In general, it’s critical not to stigmatise failure: if you do, opportunities for learning will disappear.

## Systems and the myth of ‘human error’

Dekker recommends that we take a systems view of team performance. While failures may naively be blamed on mistakes or ‘human error’, most organisational systems are driven close to the limits of what they can safely deliver (and often beyond). Deadlines, competing priorities and brittle processes requiring workarounds all contribute to conditions in which failures aren’t due to personal mistakes or ‘human error’. Instead, they are merely a consequence of the organisational constraints and pressures which staff do their best to navigate with the limited information available to them in the moment. In this context, failure is not a moral deficiency but a product of dynamic complexity. Our job is to find ways to manage this complexity in order to reduce the prevalence or scale of failure.

# Preconditions for accountability

Giving frontline staff a voice to tell their stories may be a necessity, but there are other prerequisites to accountability and sustaining an effective learning culture.

## Authority

Dekker calls out the “authority–responsibility mismatch” as a common problem:

> It is impossible to hold somebody accountable for something over which that person had no authority.

He observes that in most safety-critical applications, operators must continually balance competing demands for efficiency and thoroughness. If an organisation doesn’t create time and space for operators to be thorough, if it doesn’t grant them the authority “to live up to the responsibility” asked of them, then the operators cannot be held accountability. The organisation must first reform itself.

## Other team capabilities

Kimball Fisher [2000] provides a helpful model for thinking about self-organising teams: using the mnemonic ARIA (Authority, Resources, Information, Accountability) he suggests that in addition to authority and accountability, teams also require the resources (i.e. skills, personnel, tools) to do their job well, and relevant information to make informed decisions. It is management’s job to develop these capabilities in order to grow the boundaries within which the team can operate with accountability.

## Psychological safety

Another important prerequisite to a learning/safety culture (and therefore to a just accountability culture) is psychological safety. As Dekker [2014] observes:

> Fear of prosecution stifles the flow of information about such conditions. And information is the prime asset that makes a safety culture work.

Amy Edmondson [2018] provides helpful guidance for leadership to build and sustain psychological safety. She summarises the activities leaders should engage in across three categories of work (“setting the stage”, “inviting participation” and “responding productively”).

## Structuring accounts

Finally, while giving frontline staff the opportunity to give their own accounts of events is important, we must take care over how we draw conclusions from these accounts.

When reasoning about outcomes in a complex dynamic system, we often erroneously assume what Dekker [2011] refers to as “linear, Newtonian-Cartesian logic” – that is, we view an outcome are a product of a linear chain of events with a “root cause”. Allspaw [2012] points out that such linear thinking “validates hindsight and outcome bias”. In fact, failure in complex systems is typically the result of “multiple contributing factors, each necessary but only jointly sufficient”. Therefore, when we analyse and synthesise recommendations from the accounts we hear of what happened, we must guard against linear thinking. Learning from failure in dynamic systems requires diligence and structure to overcome human cognitive limitations in the face of systems complexity.

An examination of the techniques available to accomplish this goal is beyond the scope of this article, but one well-researched example is the US military’s approach to conducting after-action reviews (AARs). The following points are worth highlighting because they contrast with the relative lack of effort often put into “Agile” retrospectives:

1. The role of the AAR facilitator is clear and demanding. Facilitators are trained in how to conduct AARs. Doctrine is clear that facilitators should plan, prepare and rehearse AARs to be effective [US Army 1993].
2. AARs are a “knowledge management challenge” [Morrison 1999]. Data are derived from personal observations from personnel, local leaders and the facilitator; from informal discussions; through interactions in the AAR; from operational models; and from analysed outcomes. The facilitator should “filter and organize the data and then prepare to present it in the AAR”.
3. AARs should be held in a timely fashion while events are fresh in memory. Moreover, AARs are embedded into structured Deming/PDCA cycles [Darling et al 2005] in order to “connect past experience with future actions” – i.e. to operationalise learning. (Contrast this with Agile retrospectives which are often held on an arbitrary cadence, and become merely a routine.)
4. Formal AARs may still be complemented with frequent, informal discussions for realtime feedback (“hot washes”) as or immediately after events occur [Morrison 1999].

# The role of management

To summarise, management should take the following steps:

1. Clarify roles (i.e. what individuals have authority over and what they will be accountable for).
2. Empower teams to do their jobs well by building capabilities (e.g. Fisher’s ARIA model for self-directed teams).
3. Create opportunities for individuals to give their account when failures occur.
4. Create time and space for staff to learn, implement recommendations and improve how they work. (To do this effectively in complex dynamic systems, it’s important to manage information and structure learning activities to guard against linear thinking.)
5. Sustain a culture of psychological safety.
6. Manage toxic and counterproductive behaviours quickly, fairly and safely.

Once management are continuously practicing these steps then, and only then, can they meaningfully talk about accountability.
