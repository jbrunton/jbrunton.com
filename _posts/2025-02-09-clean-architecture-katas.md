It's always a good idea to practice. Here are a few references to katas for practicing [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) ideas, including one I created for my own practice purposes.

## Game of Life kata

I drafted a kata based on Conway's Game of Life, which can be found here:

There is a TypeScript template available (with a bunch of config and boilerplate already dealt with) intended to make jumping into the exercise easy:
