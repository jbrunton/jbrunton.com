I created a 'cheat sheet' for the excellent [Helping: How to Offer, Give, and Receive Help](https://www.amazon.com/Helping-Offer-Give-Receive-Help-ebook/dp/B005P2A6TI) by Edgar Schein.

It's tough to distil everything in the book down to two sides of A4, but I find this makes for a useful reference and reminder.

You can download the PDF [here](https://jbrunton.github.io/cheat-sheets/humble-inquiry.pdf).
